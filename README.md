# Introduction
This repository stores part of the group coursework for year 2 project management module (PD&PPM). This contains the code for the Android Application.

# What is it?
The idea of the program was to be an app for a venue which would host events, the app would show those events to the user and they could add the events to their calendar. There are some features that didn't get implemented due to time constraints, these include notifications for events that the user could register for and filtering by event genre.
